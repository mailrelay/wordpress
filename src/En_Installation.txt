------ Installing MailRelay plugin for Wordpress -------
--------------------------------------------------------

The installation of the MailRelay plugin product for Wordpress is very simple. It only takes a few steps to do it.

After installing the extension a new menu will appear on the left panel, this menu will let you sync all your Wordpress users with your Mailrelay account.
This will save you time when syncing and organizing your users in groups.

Let's start with the installation process:

-------------------
First required step
-------------------

The first step, in order for us to be able to use the extension, is to enable the API key of our Mailrelay account. For that we need to log in our Mailrelay account
admin panel. Once we are there we will go to the "Settings" menu, then "API access". On that screen click on the "Generate new API key" button.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Upload the necessary files to the server or install it direct from WordPress repository
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Mailrelay plugins comes into a .zip file. To upload it we will go to the left menu Plugins > Add new. Then you click on the Upload tab that will allow you to
install a plugin from archive. A file box will appear where you can upload the mailrelay zip file. The plugin will be uploaded to your blog and installed.
Please note that you have to give write access to your wp-content/plugins folder.

You can also install the Mailrelay plugin straight from the WordPress repository. In the left menu Plugins > Add new. Then you will search for Mailrelay in the Search Plugins area. Then you just need to click the Install Now button and wait for it to be installed, after that click on the Activate button.

-------------------------
Configuring the extension
-------------------------

Once the extension is installed we will have a new settings option. We will go to Mailrelay on the left Menu.
You will be taken into a form that you need to fill the following data:

- Account (this can be found in your Mailrelay welcome email). 
- API key (the API key generated for our Mailrelay account).

Once this data is successfully saved we can start the user sync.

--------
Settings
--------

After the configuration, we will click on Save button. If settings are correct, this will take us to a screen where you can select if you want to 
Automatically syncronize all your users to your Mailrelay account and with which group (from 1 to all).

-----------
Manual Sync
-----------

In the Manual Sync tab you can select the groups of your Mailrelay account that you want your WordPress users synced to. 
We will click them and will press the Sync button.

We will see the following screen, that simply shows us the sync process. It shows the total users synced, total users updated and fails.

[ NOTE: Depending on the number of users to sync, the process can take from some seconds to several minutes. ]

---------
Uninstall
---------

Uninstalling the extension is as easy as installing it. You only have to go to Plugins > Installed plugins.
You must search for the Mailrelay module and click on Deactivate. Selecting this option, the extension will be disabled.
Next you can click on the Delete link to complete remove the extension.
